# Deques-and-Randomized-Queues
Generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue.

## Dequeue
A double-ended queue or deque is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

## Randomized queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

### External JARs used
The library [alg4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) from the course was used.
